# hello_world

This is my first foray into android app development.  
Here the focus was familiarizing myself with Android Studio, and understanding basic functionalites such as buttons, colors, orientation, and more. 
Hello everyone!  I'm an Android developer now!  Got lots to learn, but with time, I'm sure it'll be great.
